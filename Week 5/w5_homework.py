Question 1
If I give you two lists of numbers, determine a list of all the numbers they have in common.
For example:
one = [1,2,3]
two = [2,3,4]
result = [2,3]
"""

listOne = [3,4,7,8,9]
listTwo = [4,5,6,7]

# Expected output:
# "the result is [4,7]"

"""
Question 2
If I give you a list, determine if it is a palindrome or not.
"""

listThree = ['a','b','c',1,'c','b','a']
# Expected output: this is a palindrome
listFour = [1,2,3,'b','d', 3,2,1]
# Expected output: this is not a palindrome

"""
Question 3
If I give you a list, write something that takes this list and makes a new list that has only the even 
elements of this list in it.
BONUS: Write it in only 1 line.

listFive = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
