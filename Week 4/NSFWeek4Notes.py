# Strings

# ---------

# String operations (review)


# ---------

# Accessing characters in a string

# - Indexing

# - Negative Indexing

# - Range

# Example

aStr = "Hello World"

# print the first char of the word using two differrent methods
# print the first three chars of the word
# print the last four chars of the word
# print all but the first 5 chars

# ---------

# Testing Strings
# Check out "https://docs.python.org/2.5/lib/string-methods.html" for more!

# Example

aStr1 = "summer is "
aStr2 = "100%"
aStr2 = " the best"

"""
We want to combine the strings, only if the format is what we want...
1. String 1 is only alphabetic 
2. String 2
	a. The last char is %
	b. The rest of the chars are numeric
3. String 3 is uppercase

Write nested if statements to check these conditions, if they are all true, print the concatanation.
"""

# ---------

# Other string functions

# - Strip

# - Upper and Lower

# ---------

# Iterating through a string is a way that we can do - or /

# Example- Remove all the l's in the following string

oldString = "lilllltslatlllhurlsdlayl"

# ---------

# Practice Problems

# 1. Swap the letters in the following string
aStr1 = "The BEST kinD of coOKies are sugar. NO CAP."

# 2. Find how many instances of "abc" are in the following string
aStr2 = "abcabbcabbcabbcabcaabcabcadbcacbchabc"

# 3. Remove any subsequent occurrence of non-distinct characters in the following string. For example: aab becomes ab
aStr3 = "aaabbbcbbcaabbca"
